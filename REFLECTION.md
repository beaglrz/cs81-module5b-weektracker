REFLECTION

1. **Were your predictions accurate?**
My guess that creative activities would fill most of my week was right. Most of what I did was schoolwork or creative things like going to class, cooking, and watching TV. I also thought evenings would have the most hours, and that was true because many of my longer activities happened then, but my guess that working out at the gym would be the most fun was only partly right. 

2. **What surprised you about your week?**
I was surprised by how much I enjoyed simple activities. Even though I spent a lot of time on schoolwork, shorter things like cooking and going to the gym were some of the most enjoyable. This showed me that spending more time does not always mean more enjoyment.

3.**Which higher order function was most useful and why?**
The most useful higher-order function for me was reduce(). It helped me add up data to find totals, averages, and the most common type of activity. Using reduce() made it easier to spot patterns in my week.
